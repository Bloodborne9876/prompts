Lora trained on 62975 images of Blue Archive Characters

This is missing a few characters and only has 86 characters in total.

This took me over 24 hours to make since I only have a 3070ti 8gb.

I release all my models for free, if you feel like supporting me and my work you can support me here and buy me a drink.

Please note that some characters may not come out perfectly due to not individually being able to select the epochs since this is a combined training and not a merge. If you find this to be the case use the individual character model instead.
